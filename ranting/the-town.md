  <h4>How I ended up here</p>
  <p>You may have heard about the year 11 notes coalition. No I'm a year 9 not a year 11 if that's what you're wondering. I am an individual entity. Kind of.</p>
  <p>You may have heard that I used to use Wix.com. This is true. Funnily enough, that site is still open, but I am not going to link to it. Haha. I used to live in a very large city with my friend <a href="https://beatricesychong.wixsite.com/notes">Beatrice</a>, and other people. It was quite a very very big city, and there wasn't much space. This is why the houses are so small. Hey Edward! I promise my house wasn't gothic themed. It was a very nice house themed with books and plants.<br>Soon enough, I had so many notes that I didn't have enough space to store all the notes. So I left the city. I still kept my diaries with me, and I was homeless for a little while.<br>Edward had been inviting me to join this town for a while, and after a few "reminders," I finally set up... but using a quartz template. I decided to move from this as well, as the house was too "tall and skinny." I didn't like so many stories so I broke down all the foundations I already had and built a phatter house that was a little more stable.</p>
