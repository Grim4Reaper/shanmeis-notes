  <h3>Researching and Planning</h3>
  <h4>Variables</h4>
  <p>Independant Variable: Voltage of the power supply (v)<br>Dependant variable: The current in series (I)<br>Controlled Variables: The resistance of the variable resistor (Ohms), resistance of the wire (Ohms), material of the wire.</p>
  <h4>Research</h4>
  <h5>1. What is Ohmic resistance?</h5>
  <p>Ohmic resistance is the sum of the resistors, resistance of the current collector, the active mass and the resistance of the wires. Basically, It is the resistance of every part of the circuit combined.</p>
