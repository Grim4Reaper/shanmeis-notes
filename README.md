# Shan-Mei's Notes!

Hi, I'm Shan-Mei, a high school year 9 student from Perth, Australia.


The purpose of these notes is to:

1. Help classmates and the junior years in catching up with work when they don't pay attention :)

2. Publicise my music theory courses and provide the free extra theory and lit content to anyone who doesn't want to pay for a course.

3. "Make education free and accessible" - Edward (don't you worry, I follow the same principle)

​

I no longer know how frequently this will be updated. Journalling will be updated almost every day, notes will be updated when I have the time.

​

These notes hopefully cover a large range of subjects, from your common core subjects to music theory to notes from sermons (Christianity based things) to tips with studying, cramming and managing stress.

​

I also included some parts of my personal "timetable" to show how I manage my time.


## Background and Inspo

I have a couple friends that first introduced and inspired me to make this :) Thanks to them, this thing exists. Some of you may know my friend Beatrice, she also has a note page on Wix. Her website will be linked below. Her note page was the first note page I was shown, and going over her website made me want to do it on Wix, but unfortunately the 100 pages limit made me swap to Github. The second notes page I was shared was by my friend Edward. His notes are on Github and I'll also be linking his notes page :)
