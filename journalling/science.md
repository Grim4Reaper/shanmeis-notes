  <h4>T1W4L2 - 21/2</h4>
  <p>- Started learning about the power equation.</p>
  <p>- Did stile for most of the class, and we revised graphing skills. I'm so glad I revised chem over the hols otherwise I would have forgotten about the line of best fit.</p>
  <p>- Hw - finish the graph</p>
  <h4>T1W4L3 - 23/2</h4>
  <p>- Did waves, learnt a lot of new things.</p>
  <p>- Working on Intro To Waves in Stile.</p>
  <p>- Had lots of issues with Wifi, wasn't able to connect the whole lesson :(</p>

  <p>- Started with light waves theory.</p>
  <p>- Finished the stile.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L2 - 28/2</h4>
  <p>- Finished the Stile. Waves quiz and Refraction.</p>
  <p>- Math text next period and my friend and I are freaking out.</p>
  <p>- We got Ms Burnett. :(( and she doesn't like that fact that some of us are not doing science.</p>
  <h4>T1W5L3 - 2/3</h4>
  <p>- We worked on Sound 1 in Stile</p>
  <p>- Unfortunately I was late because there was an accident in Cockburn and our relief teacher was Ms Enslin... and she didn't give my friend and I the easiest time explaining why the kiosk doesn't print out a note.</p>

  <h4>T1W6L2 - 9/3</h4>

  <h4>T1W6L3 - 10/3</h4>
  <p>- Did the science inquiry practice test. Don't think I'll manage to finish the real test in time unfortunately. Gotta write faster.
